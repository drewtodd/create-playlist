# Git Commit Guidelines

These conventions ensure clarity and consistency in commit history for this project.

## Commit Title Format

Use the following format:

```
<type>: <imperative, lowercase summary>
```

* **Use lowercase** for both `<type>` and the summary.
* **Imperative mood**: Describe what the commit *does*, not what it *did* (e.g., "add support" not "added support").
* Limit to **50 characters** or less when possible.

### Examples

```
feat: add --genre filter to CLI
fix: handle missing metadata gracefully
docs: update README with usage instructions
chore: configure ruff and black
```
